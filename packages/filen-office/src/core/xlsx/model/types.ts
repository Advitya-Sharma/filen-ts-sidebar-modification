// The lossless workbook model the reader builds, edits change and the splice writer saves. Untouched parts stay

// rows remember their byte span in the source part, so a save rewrites only what an edit touched. Nothing holds
// one object per cell.
//
// Rules the reader, the edits and the writer share:
// - Byte spans are offsets into a part's inflated bytes as the source zip holds them. The writer inflates the part
//   again at save; nothing keeps a sheet's inflated bytes after it is parsed.
// - Change marks are conservative: anything marked may equal its source, and the writer then emits the source
//   bytes (a row, a cell, a section, a part), so an edit and its undo save byte-identical.
// - Inside a rewritten row, a cell equal to its source is copied from its source bytes (its unknown attributes,
//   vm, ph and extLst kept, `r` rewritten when it moved); only cells that differ are serialised from the store.
// - Records are append-only: styles, shared strings and formulas are never reindexed, so other sheets keep their
//   bytes.
