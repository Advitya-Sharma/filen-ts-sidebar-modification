// come back as the same bytes even when the true source encoding was really 1250, 1251, GBK, or another

// a character the table cannot hold is refused outright (see the text session and canEncodeWindows1252), not
// silently reformatted.
// `writable` is false when the source bytes hold a byte windows-1252 leaves undefined, or when they read
// as confidently non-Western text — both cases where editing would show confusing mojibake.
