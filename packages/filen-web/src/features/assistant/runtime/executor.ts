// since the handles it hands out ("f3", "d1", "n2", "c4", "p1", "t5") live as long as the conversation
// does. UUIDs never reach the model.
//
// Per call the loop runs check() before the guard (a "/path" where a handle belongs comes back as the
// item's handle, a name as candidate handles), asks the user to confirm a consequential call (preview()
// fills the card), then execute() with `confirmed`. draft_chat_message is consequential: it writes the
