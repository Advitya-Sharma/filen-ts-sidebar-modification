// Content-Type, Range/206-capable) and returns its fetchable, same-origin URL — the src a
// <video>/<audio>/<img> element streams+seeks against directly. Rides saveDownload.ts's shared
// registration seam (session handoff + restart healing), minus the FSA branch and the plain-navigation
// trigger: an inline media element just needs a stable URL, it never "saves" anything.
//
// Passing an earlier `id` re-registers it (the worker may have been restarted or evicted it since),
// so a revisit gets back the same URL rather than a new one. A video or audio element's registration goes
// in the worker's player bucket, which downloads cannot crowd out; `transient` marks a short-lived use (a
// thumbnail's one frame), kept apart so it can never evict a player's either.
//
// `access: "anon"` is a public link's file, which only the SDK worker's unauthenticated client can read: that
// worker serves its ranges on a port (openLinkedRangePortAnon) and the port goes to the service worker,
// which answers the same route by reading through it. The file handle and its key stay in the SDK worker.
// It rejects at once, before any SDK work, when the controlling worker is older than this page's protocol
// (or nothing controls the page), so the caller falls back to MediaSource without waiting on it. A
// registration that a newer one of the same id overtakes resolves with that one; one released while still
// on its way rejects with an AbortError.
