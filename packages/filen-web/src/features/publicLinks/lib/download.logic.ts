// page's own download streams through the service worker into the browser's download (it only pipes, so an
// anonymous visitor needs no session there). Only where neither exists is the whole file buffered in memory,
// which is what the caps below bound.

// The one place the buffered ceiling lives. A browser with neither FSA nor the service worker route must hold
// the entire file in memory as a Blob before the anchor-download fires; past this it would risk crashing the
// tab, so the UI shows an honest "too large — use a Chromium browser or the desktop app" note instead.
